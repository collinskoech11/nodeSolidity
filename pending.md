Challenges 

Areas to focus on (Front runner bot (slippage, gas ))

Lessons learnt (Discoveries)
Next steps (Onceapp pekee) -> mobile app -> web app version + additional features 

Have a look at the milestones(Deliverables)



Algorand focus areas (Languages Teal and Javascript )
Create marketplace for selling NFTs
 
 Discoveries 
Less projects on algorand -> most are closed source 
Teal Programming language  LOw level languaege -> assembly language 

Challenges 
Learning Teal -> Low level language 


Phase 2 => Intergrating smart contract with UI 


Pancake swap 
Challenges 
Rughs -> Tokens bought that cant be sold (How to solve -> rug doc (Simulating the trade check )) Risk analysis  AXIOS -> 
Finding a pair not to be of base token Bnb -> base token Busd 
Provider not giving transaction data (Late) -> Mempool all transactions go before mining 
 => causes buying delay
Developing simulation logic (Broadcast a transaction)
Before transacting you have to simulate to check if the transaction is profitable 
Unable to frontrun =>BUying the same block but different positions 

Area of Focus
Calculating slippage -> Pricing pact 
Calculating buy attack amount 

Discoveries 
Optimization => Getting the right parameters gas optimization 
 -> comparing two target tx 


Sandwich (Pool  combination of a token pair base token rbnb )
